Sandbox Overview
###################

.. warning::
    The sandbox deployment is not suitable for production environments. For an in-depth overview of how to productionize your Flyte deployment, checkout the :ref:`deployment` guide.


**********************
What is Flyte Sandbox?
**********************
The Flyte Sandbox is a fully standalone minimal environment for running Flyte. To simplify this further :std:ref:`flytectl_sandbox` provides a simplified way of running ``flyte-sandbox`` as a single Docker container running locally.
The follow section explains how you can use each of these modes and provides more information. We **recommend** running the sandbox using flytectl locally on your workstation or on a single cloud instance to try out Flyte or for testing new ideas. Flyte Sandbox is not a complete representation of Flyte,
many features are intentionally removed from this environment to ensure that the startup times and runtime footprints are low.

*******************************************
Flyte Sandbox as a single Docker container
*******************************************

:std:ref:`flytectl_sandbox` starts a local sandbox environment for Flyte. This is mini-replica of an entire Flyte deployment, without the scalability and with minimal extensions. The idea for this environment originated from the desire of the core team to make it extremely simple for users of Flyte to
try out the platform and get a feel for the user experience, without having to understand Kubernetes or dabble with configuration etc. The Flyte single container sandbox is also used by the team to run continuous integration tests and used by the `flytesnacks - UserGuide playground environment`. The sandbox can be run
in most any environment that supports Docker containers and an Ubuntu docker base image.

Architecture and reasons why we built it?
=========================================
Within the single container environment, a mini Kubernetes cluster is installed using the excellent `k3s <https://k3s.io/>`__ platform. K3s uses an in-container Docker daemon (run using `docker-in-docker configuration <https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-can-now-run-within-docker/>`__) to orchestrate user containers.

When users call ``flytectl sandbox start --source <dir>``, the source ``<dir>`` is mounted within the sandbox container and hence it is possible to build images for that source code, using the inner Docker daemon. In a typical Flyte installation, one needs to build Docker containers for tasks and push them to a repository from which K8s can pull.
This is not possible with the sandbox's Docker environment however, because it does not ship with a Docker registry. Users are free to use an external registry of course, as long as the inner k3s cluster has permissions to pull from it. To reduce the friction of procuring such a registry, and configuring permissions to access it, and having to explicitly push to it,
we recommend using the ``flytectl sandbox exec -- ...`` mode to trigger a Docker build for your code (which is mounted in the sandbox environment) using the docker-in-docker daemon. Since K3s just uses the same Docker daemon, it is possible to re-use the images built internally. This greatly simplifies the user's interaction and ability to try out Flyte, at the cost of hiding one part of the real-world iteration cycle, calling ``docker push`` on your task images.

The illustration below shows the archtecture of flyte-sandbox in a single container. It is identical to a Flyte sandbox cluster, but the fact that we have built one docker container, with kubernetes and flyte already installed.

Use the Flyte Sandbox to
========================
* Try out Flyte locally using a single Docker command or using ``flytectl sandbox``
* Run regular integration tests for Flyte
* Provide snapshot environment for various Flyte versions, to identify regressions

***************************************************************
Deploying your own Flyte Sandbox environment to a K8s cluster
***************************************************************

This installs all the dependencies as Kubernetes deployments. We call this a Sandbox deployment. Flyte sandbox deployment can be deployed using the default Helm chart.

.. note::

    #. A Sandbox deployment takes over the entire cluster
    #. It needs special cluster roles that will need access to create namespaces, pods etc
    #. The sandbox deployment is not suitable for production environments. For an in-depth overview of how to productionize your Flyte deployment, checkout the rest of the Deployment guides :ref:`deployment`.

Deploy Flyte Sandbox environment laptop / workstation / single machine
=======================================================================

Ensure ``kubectl`` is installed. Follow `kubectl installation docs <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/>`__. On Mac::

    brew install kubectl

.. tabs::

    .. tab:: Docker Image

        Recommend using ``flytectl sandbox`` as describe in  to :ref:`gettingstarted_implement`

        .. prompt:: bash $

              docker run --rm --privileged -p 30081:30081 -p 30084:30084 cr.flyte.org/flyteorg/flyte-sandbox

    .. tab:: k3d

        .. TODO::

            These instructions currently still rely on the old kustomize setup, we are moving them over to the Helm chart soon.

        #. Install k3d Using ``curl``::

            curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/k3d/main/install.sh | bash

           Or Using ``wget`` ::

            wget -q -O - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rancher/k3d/main/install.sh | bash

        #. Start a new K3s cluster called flyte::

            k3d cluster create -p "30081:30081" --no-lb --k3s-server-arg '--no-deploy=traefik' --k3s-server-arg '--no-deploy=servicelb' flyte

        #. Ensure the context is set to the new cluster::

            kubectl config set-context flyte

        #. Install Flyte::

            kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flyteorg/flyte/master/deployment/sandbox/flyte_generated.yaml


        #. Connect to `FlyteConsole <localhost:30081/console>`__
        #. [Optional] You can delete the cluster once you are done with the tutorial using - ::

            k3d cluster delete flyte

        .. note::

            #. Sometimes Flyteconsole will not open up. This is probably because your docker networking is impacted. One solution is to restart docker and re-do the previous steps.
            #. To debug you can try a simple excercise - run nginx as follows::

                docker run -it --rm -p 8083:80 nginx

               Now connect to `locahost:8083 <localhost:8083>`__. If this does not work, then for sure the networking is impacted, please restart docker daemon.

            These instructions currently still rely on the old kustomize setup, we are moving them over to the Helm chart soon.

        #. `Install Docker for mac with Kubernetes as explained here <https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-mac-kubernetes/>`_
        #. Make sure Kubernetes is started and once started make sure your kubectx is set to the `docker-desktop` cluster, typically ::

                kubectl config set-context docker-desktop

        #. Install Flyte::

            kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flyteorg/flyte/master/deployment/sandbox/flyte_generated.yaml

        #. Connect to `FlyteConsole <localhost/console>`__

    .. tab::  Using Minikube (Not recommended)

        .. TODO::

            These instructions currently still rely on the old kustomize setup, we are moving them over to the Helm chart soon.

        #. Install `Minikube <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/>`_

        #. Install Flyte::

            kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flyteorg/flyte/master/deployment/sandbox/flyte_generated.yaml

        .. note::

            - Minikube runs in a Virtual Machine on your host
            - So if you try to access the flyte console on localhost, that will not work, because the Virtual Machine has a different IP address.
            - Flyte runs within Kubernetes (minikube), thus to access FlyteConsole, you cannot just use https://localhost:30081/console, you need to use the IP address of the minikube VM instead of localhost
            - Refer to https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/hello-minikube/ to understand how to access a
                also to register workflows, tasks etc or use the CLI to query Flyte service, you have to use the IP address.
            - If you are building an image locally and want to execute on Minikube hosted Flyte environment, please push the image to docker registry running on the Minikube VM.
            - Another alternative is to change the docker host, to build the docker image on the Minikube hosted docker daemon. https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/handbook/pushing/ provides more detailed information about this process. As a TL;DR, Flyte can only run images that are accessible to Kubernetes. To make an image accessible, you could either push it to a remote registry or to a regisry that is available to Kuberentes. In case on minikube this registry is the one thats running on the VM.

Deploy Flyte Sandbox environment to a Cloud Kubernetes cluster
==================================================================

Cluster Requirements
---------------------

Ensure you have kubernetes up and running on your choice of cloud provider:

- `AWS EKS <https://aws.amazon.com/eks/>`_ (Amazon)
- `GCP GKE <https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/>`_ (Google)
- `Azure AKS <https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/kubernetes-service/>`_ (Microsoft)

If you can access your cluster with ``kubectl cluster-info``, you're ready to deploy Flyte.


Deployment
-----------

We'll proceed like with :ref:`locally hosted flyte <deploy-sandbox-local>` with deploying the sandbox
Flyte configuration on your remote cluster.

#. The Flyte sandbox can be deployed with a single command ::

    kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flyteorg/flyte/master/deployment/sandbox/flyte_generated.yaml

#. You can now port-forward (or if you have load-balancer enabled then get an LB) to connect to remote FlyteConsole, as follows::

    kubectl port-forward svc/envoy 30081:80 -n projectcontour

#. Open console http://localhost:30081/console.
